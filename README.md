# Summary

ZIO Query adds efficient pipelining, batching, and caching to any data source.

ZIO Query helps you dramatically reduce load on data sources and improve performance.

- **Pipelining**. ZIO Query detects parts of composite queries that can be combined together for fewer individual requests to the data source.
- **Batching**. ZIO Query detects parts of composite queries that can be executed in parallel without changing the semantics of the query.
- **Caching**. ZIO Query can transparently cache read queries to minimize the cost of fetching the same item repeatedly in the scope of a query.

Compared with Fetch, ZIO Query supports response types that depend on request types, does not require higher-kinded types and implicits, supports ZIO environment and statically typed errors, and has no dependencies except for ZIO.
